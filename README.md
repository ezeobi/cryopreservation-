# cryopreservation-


My name is obinna.  am 45 years old , cryobiologist. 

I have a dog that I love with all my heart . the dog's name is  simiri. 


anyway,  I will tell you how my dog died and revived through cryopreservation.

it was on 7th july 2018 , just like any other day; I was walking with simiri in the town park , on a hot summer day  . 

Simiri and I where playing fetch , like any other day , I threw stick and he fetched it. 


It was getting boring , just doing the same thing every day , so I did something new for a change .


We walked and walked  until we reached our destination. 

        The town swimming pool!
        
        I love swimming! 

luckily I wore my bathing suit under my clothes since I always plan of swimming. 

I took of my clothes and jumped into the swimming pool but I told him not to come into the pool . 

Simiri accidentally fell into the pool and he was drowned. 

I dove underwater and carried him out of the water , and then placed him out of the pool .I looked at him but he was not looking at me . 

"Simiri? " I called 

"Boy?" I called again , don't play dead; speak! 

He didn't move . 

I placed my hand on his heart but he was not breathing,  I then noticed that he is dead! 



I rushed and took him to my  cryobiology laboratory 

I lowered his temperature to 68 degree farenheit and replaced his blood with blood substitute , made up of common salt solution with drug , sugar and starch to regulate its chemistry and prevent clotting. 


The dog to 37 degrees farenheit and then circulation was restarted . I warmed up the dog and replaced the blood substitute with His blood  , then my Simiri was back to life .



I then took him home and was sound and Healthy. 

How I reacted 


I was extremely happy . it was eucatastrophic 



Hope we can get from It 

cryopreservation will bring  extraordinary change to  humanity in terms of longevity. It will enable  us  to solve many problems that hinders humanly.
